Features:

*Collect data about commodities available in different star systems and stations.

*Adviser will determine all profitable trades. Trade data for commodities is available and can be sorted and filtered.

*Adviser will determine optimal manifests between systems. A manifest is a collection of trades and is optimized based
on the supply of the commodity, the Commander's available capital to invest, and the number of free cargo holds the
Commander has.

*Adviser will plot trade routes based on manifest data. A full route is a circuit of manifests starting and ending at
the same system and station. The key metric to the routes is Average Profit per Trip.
